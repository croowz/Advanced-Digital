\section{Lab Purpose} \vspace{-.7cm} \line(1,0){470}
	\paragraph{}
		With the design of the toy processor complete, we can now implement it physically. With some tweaks to make it compatible, we can put it on the Basys2 board and load some simple programs onto it. 
		
\section{Implementation Details} \vspace{-.7cm} \line(1,0){470}
		
		
	\subsection{Part 1 - Clock and Bypass Circuits}

	\textbf{Clock}\\
	The clock for the processor, when implemented on the board, will be provided by the board. 
	This clock is too fast for human reading, so we will generate a push button clock and step through each operation.

	reg CLK = 1'b0;
	reg PUSH = 1'b0;

	wire SIG;

	initial // Clock process for CLK

				CLK = 1'b0;
				#100; 
				CLK = 1'b1;
				#100;
			end

		.PUSH(PUSH),

			#400;
			PUSH = 1'b1;
			#600;
			PUSH = 1'b0;

		end
endmodule

		\end{Verbatim}
		The test bench simply simulates button presses, and covers the test case of a holding the button as well. Results of the waveform are shown in the Expirimental Results section.\\\newline\textbf{Bypass}\\
		To avoid having to press the button 256 times to transition states, we designed a bypass so that the clock is automatic.

		\subsection{Part 2 - Programming the Basys2 Board}
		To make the processor compatible with the board and for it to be testable, we must program the seven segment display, similar to how we have done in previous labs. It will display the instructions, as well as the accumulator.

		 \begin{figure}[h]
		 	\includegraphics[scale=.5]{toyProcessor_Overall.PNG}
		 	\caption{Modifications to the ToyProcessorOverall schematic to add the seven segment displays.}
		 \end{figure}
\newpage

With the board ready for programs, we can now enter machinecode into ROM and actually see its output on the seven segment display. We will design two programs, with the 2nd testing all of the capabilities of our ToyProcessor.\\

The first program that we will load onto the board simply sums the numbers from 1-9 using the ADD instruction and then stores that sum. This program is not self-modifying, does not loop, and is linear -- it ends after the first run.

This program stricly speaking does the exact same thing as the program above. This program summs the values from 0 - 9 and stores the answer. The difference of the program from the other is that it is entirly self-modifying, includes basic branching, and the use of all the instructions that we programmed for the CPU. We begin by clearing/soft-reset. We than add 10 and subtract 1 and then store the value. We do this rather than add 9 so that we can simply loop through the above portion and run though all the number from 9 to 0. If we started with 9 we would only get 8 to 0. Once we store the value we branch back to the add unless it is zero. This will add 8 then 7 then 6 and so on and so forth. Finally we store the resulting value.

	This maps everything to components on the board of the BASys. Mapping S0-S5, mem-en, and overflow to the LEDs above the switchs. Two buttons for bypassing the clock and reset and the clock to the clock. We also mapped all four digits to the for seven segements and each of the segements to the specific LEDs. The last portion is to initialize all the values of ROM and in this particular case is simple add.

\section{Experimental Results}\vspace{-.7cm} \line(1,0){470}
	\subsection{Clock Signal Testbench}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=.4]{signal.PNG}\\
		\end{center}

		In this testbench you can see the clock signal schematic passes through one clock signal from the actual clock to signal out when the button attached to the PUSH variable is pushed. Note that you can see from the second push that it does not matter how long you push or hold the button attached to PUSH, one push will always pass one rising and fall clock edge not matter the hold time.

	\subsection{Bypass Clock Signal Testbench}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=.4]{bypass.PNG}\\
		\end{center}

		This testbench demostrates the Bypass Clock Signal and is built off of Clock Signal tested above. This is supposed to combine the need to write all of ROM to RAM at the beginning of the program and the need to have a button pass through just one clock edge. Notice that on a RESET the Signal Out mirrors the actual clock signal until OVERFLOW goes high. This is because we need the signal out to mirror the clock to continually copy ROM to RAM without pushing any button. Moreover notice that before OVERFLOW goes high it doesnt matter how hard long or often you push the button attached to PUSH nothing happens. After OVERFLOW goes high everything acts exactly as it did in the clock signal testbench unless you hit RESET starting the whole process over again.

	\subsection{Running the Toy Processor on the BASys Board}
		The third portion of the demonstration was putting everything together, writting a UCF file, program ROM, and put it all on the board to run and test the whole processor. For the demo we ran a simple counter from 0 - 9 the logical way and a needlessly complicated way. The exact processes are explained above. The board operated entirely as expected.
	
	\newpage
\section{Significance} \vspace{-.7cm} \line(1,0){470}
	\paragraph{} 
		This is what we have been working towards all semester. We have completed the memory ROM and RAM logic and practiced writing a program in ROM and testbenching everything put together. Finally we needed to manage having the ROM actually write its entire contents to RAM and have a button operate the pass through of the clock. Now we can write any program using the basic instructions we have encoded as long as it fits in memory. We have finally completed our own very very very simple processor.

 \section{Comments/Suggestions}\vspace{-.7cm} \line(1,0){470}
 	\paragraph{} 
 		The programming requirement counting from 0 - 9 in such a conviluted way as to use all the instructions is understandable but is far to complicated. You should either come up with an program that uses all the instructions more naturally or makes more sense or have each group write any of there own useful program so long as it uses all instructions.
